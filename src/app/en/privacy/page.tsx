                            In general, information is used within the service for the following purposes

                                Without the storage of customer information, some of the basic functions that make up the
                                service may not be possible. An example of this is the storage of settings.</p>
                            <p>In this case, if the information is not stored, the function of the application itself
                                will not be possible in the first place.

                                By analyzing how the app is being used and what kind of customers are using it, we can make
                                the app better.</p>
                            <p>Also, when a problem occurs with an app, knowing which device or version is causing the
                                problem can help us solve the problem faster.

                                By analyzing how the application is being used and what kind of customers are using it, we
                                can suggest content and behavior that customers are looking for.</p>
