# Mahjong Tile Converter
Mahjong Tile Converter is an application for Japanese Mahjong only. Please note that it does not currently support Taiwanese or Chinese Mahjong at this time. When representing the appearance of mahjong tiles, we think that they are often represented in mpsz format as shown below. 123m123789p123s11z This program converts this kind of notation into a graphical representation using Unicode, and since it is Unicode, you can freely paste it on your blog, note application, etc. It will definitely be easier to communicate than before.

The following features also make it easier to use
1. Advanced conversions (‰∏Ä‰∫å‰∏â‚ë†‚ë°‚ë¢‚ë¶‚ëß‚ë®123Êù±Êù±) are also supported (however, not all notation methods are supported).
