# Simple Editor X
Simple Editor X is a simple notepad and text editor that can be saved as a text file. It can count the number of characters, words, sentences, and paragraphs, and can read out sentences.

Simple Editor X has the following features
1. Read-out function
This notepad has a function that reads out the text you have entered, allowing you to check for any unnatural points in the text. The text-to-speech function supports 64 languages, including Japanese, English (U.S.), and French (France), and the language can be changed in the settings.
(However, it is only a function to read out txt files, so it is not possible to make kanji read in a different way.)
2. Text language and emotion detection
It analyzes the text and identifies the language. If the text is in English, the machine learning will also use a numerical value between -1 and 1 to represent the emotion.
3. Synchronization by iCloud
This feature allows you to sync your settings and text files with the Simple Editor X app on other devices. This feature eliminates the need to customize settings multiple times.
4. Display text information
It can display the number of characters or words in a text, the number of sentences or paragraphs. It can also display the size of the dext.
5. Insert canned text
Registered text can be inserted.

*Please refer to the terms and conditions of Apple's operating system for handling audio files produced with this application.
