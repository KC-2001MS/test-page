# Uncheck X

Have you ever checked items that you did not agree to when buying something or creating an account for a service?
Uncheck X returns checkboxes and radio buttons that are selected by default on a Web site to the deselected state. This reduces the need to uncheck checkboxes and radio buttons that have been added without your permission.
